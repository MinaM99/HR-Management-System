## ÔøΩ API Response Structure

### Department Responses (DTO-based)

The API now uses optimized DTOs to prevent circular references and improve performance:

#### Basic Department Response (List/Search endpoints)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Departments retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Engineering",
      "description": "Software development team",
      "employeeCount": 15,
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T10:00:00",
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-01T10:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Features Implemented
- **Layered Architecture**: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Entity
- **DTO Pattern**: Data Transfer Objects prevent circular references and optimize responses
- **Jackson Annotations**: `@JsonManagedReference` and `@JsonBackReference` for entity relationships
- **Selective Loading**: Employees loaded only when explicitly requested
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions with global exception handler
- **Validation**: Bean validation with custom validators
- **Audit Trail**: Automatic timestamps for all entities
- **Health Checks**: Docker health checks and Spring actuator
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive Swagger documentation

### Database Migration
The application uses JPA with `hibernate.ddl-auto=update` for automatic schema management. For production, consider using Flyway or Liquibase for versioned migrations.

## üìä Sample Data

The application includes sample data for testing:
- 6 departments (HR, IT, Finance, Marketing, Operations, Sales)
- 8 employees across different departments
- Sample leave requests with different statuses
- Sample payroll records

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Lazy Loading**: JPA relationships configured with appropriate fetch types
- **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP for database connection management
- **Caching**: Ready for Redis/Hazelcast integration
- **Pagination**: Repository methods support Spring Data pagination

## üîí Security Notes

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries through JPA
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable for different environments
- **Authentication**: Ready for Spring Security integration

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment-specific Configuration
1. Create `application-prod.properties` for production settings
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Configure proper logging levels
4. Set up database connection pooling
5. Configure monitoring and health checks

### Recommended Infrastructure
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx or Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: MySQL cluster or Amazon RDS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack or centralized logging
